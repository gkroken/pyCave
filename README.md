# pyCave
Colossal Cave, l'Ã©dition fonctionnelle

## Motivation
This is an attempt at remaking [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure), a text based game from 1976, but theres a twist... We'd like to stick to [*functional programming*](https://docs.python.org/3.9/howto/functional.html) (at least for game features). 

This is so that we can learn a bit about how functinal programming can (or can not) work in python whilst reviewing some video game history. 

### TODO:

* Set up game loop
* Settle on application architecture 
* Decide how to store game text and assets
  * start importing game text
* Decide how much testing we'd like to do
* Start writing some code...
